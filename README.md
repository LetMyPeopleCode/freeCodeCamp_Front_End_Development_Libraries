# freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects

These are my solutions to the five final projects for the freeCodeCamp "Front End Development Libraries" certification.

- [Random Quote Machine](/p-Random_Quote_Machine/)
- [Markdown Previewer](/p-Markdown_Previewer/)
- [Drum Machine](/p-Drum_Machine/)
- [JavaScript Calculator](/p-JavaScript_Calculator/)
- [25 + 5 Clock](/p-25_+_5_Clock/)

## Personal Notes:

While I'm realizing this course and certification are a bit basic (i.e. no mention of the React Router which I see come up in so many React topics), I'm a n00b to React, so that's good. And while I was able to speed through the JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures projects in less than a day, I'm expecting these to take up to a week. We'll see.
