# freeCodeCamp Front End Libraries Projects

These are my solutions to the five final projects for the freeCodeCamp "Front End Development Libraries" certification.

- [Random Quote Machine](/p-Random_Quote_Machine/)
- [Markdown Previewer](/p-Markdown_Previewer/)
- [Drum Machine](/p-Drum_Machine/)
- [JavaScript Calculator](/p-JavaScript_Calculator/)
- [25 + 5 Clock](/p-25_+_5_Clock/)

## Personal Notes:

Started with the FCC base template (https://codepen.io/pen?template=MJjpwO), then added SCSS preprocessing, Bootstrap 5.1.3 (JS and CSS), React and ReactDOM (17.0.2), and jQuery (3.6).

Saved it as a new template: https://codepen.io/pen/?template=xxXEWPY

I'd originally tried to get the most minimal equivalent of this running locally, but kept running into issues. After a couple of hours, I asked myself "why do I insist on ratholing on a local dev environment that meets specs?" So I stopped fighting the easier path.
