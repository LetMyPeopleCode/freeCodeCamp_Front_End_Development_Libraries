# COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL
Items in this folder may be copyrighted and are not subject to the FLOSS licensing of the rest of the repo.

Remember, not everything you find online is free. That's how I earned $140 from PornHub when they used a piece of exclusive clipart from a site I used to own in an April Fools gag. They made the mistake of thinking they could use it without a license. I sent them a bill. They paid it.

For example, in the `sounds` folder, the items all come from free sample packs, which I have a license to use, but not to distribute on their own. I am not offering these sounds for use or distribution by others or in other projects. Just using Github to host them in mine.
